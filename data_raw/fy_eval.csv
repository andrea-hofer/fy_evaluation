As an applied person, I would have appreciated learning more useful things, e.g. how to derive an estimator (which, except for GMM, we didn't)","5","Especially in the first term, the workload was very heavy and kind of suffocating. The second term was much better to that regard, but I think the program would benefit a lot from more carefully allocating time and resources between the three main courses. The first semester, we did not do anything at all in Metrics, which turned out to be good since Micro and Macro were incredibly intense. But cutting some topics in Macro and making sure we have a good basis in Stats seems more important to me. ","5","It was good to have time during the math camp to get to know each other. Maybe during the beginning, there could be one or two more department events, like a common dinner etc to facilitate getting to know each other. ","4","Especially during the first term, some people got very competitive which was not very beneficial and counterproductive for studying. I think this could be mediated by emphasizing group work aspects more. ","1","In the first semester, there weren't any study groups that would meet regularily to solve Psets etc, which made it hard to catch up with the material. I think the department needs to do more to encourage group work. One thing that worked well with that regard was that in Micro, we had to submit Psets in the group before the TA session and during the TA session, people were selected at random to present an exercise. This really helped to form groups and work with our peers. ","1","","3","Group work didn't work out really well, esp. not in the beginning. In general, my feeling is that we had some students for whom most things were quite easy and so they did not participate much and weren't present at the office often. It'd be good to find a better way for people to benefit from each other's knowledge. For us, people who knew the material mainly just withdrew and did other things, while the rest was trying to catch up.","1","Especially in the first term, there was no focus (nor material) in metrics. Micro I was good in terms of workload and topics covered, but I would have preferred a slimmer schedule for Macro and instead learn more things in Metrics I. In my opinion, it might be beneficial to move Winkelmanns part from Metrics II into the first semester (to make sure we learn at least something), and focus the entire second semester on the topics Pietro covered and learn how to derive things (instead of just scratching on the surface of all the different estimation methods). The second semester, the workload between the courses was much more equally distributed. ","4","Maybe in general, having classes more in blocks (e.g. 8-12) works better to have time in the afternoon and evening to study. We often had 10-12 and then 2-4, which kind of ruined the whole day. ","3","Would be preferable to have midterms, as a feedback loop and also in terms of getting to know what professors expect.

"2017/08/21 10:38:52 PM GMT+2","3","see Q3","4","see Q3","1","This is a general comments related to previous three questions. It would be extremely efficient if the exemption of courses can be warranted on an individual basis, possibly even without means of examination. I would argue both current situation (1) where taking all three courses is mandatory and the situation (2) where exemption is based on passing entry-exam would incur welfare loss.

To illustrate, suppose a person likes macro so much, wants to do research on macro, and performs A+ in macro in the previous degree which covers most of the first year material in macro here (suppose he is not so fascinated with / good at micro): what is the welfare consequence of him (1) to take all three courses again? or (2) to exempt some courses based on an entry examination?

(Case 1: the current situation) he again performs well in macro because he likes it so much. However, the marginal gain is quite limited since he knew most of the material. Meanwhile, the opportunity cost of attending lectures, handing in problem sets, preparing for exams is high enough to occupy most of his working time. On the other hand, he could learn a lot from the courses, but most likely from micro, the one he is least good at from the beginning. This provides marginal amount of preparation for his research at best.

(Case 2) Macro is most likely exempted for him since he is so good at it that he can pass the entry-exam with reasonably amount of preparation. Then he most likely ends up learning a lot from micro, the one he is least good at from the beginning. This provides marginal amount of preparation for his research at best, again.","3","","5","","1","","5","","4","","3","","5","","4","","4","","5","","5","","5","","4","","4","3","3","5","1","4","3","1","My reaction to adding more programming materials in any of the three first-year courses or putting programming course in the first year would always be a ""no"".

"2017/08/29 1:59:35 AM GMT+2","2","I felt in general that the teaching quality was poor. This is of course subjective, but relative to my masters, I thought the teaching at UZH was not up to snuff. There were of course exceptions, notably Andreas Hefti and Pietro Biroli, but I felt throughout the year that the lack of good teaching made it difficult to digest and understand the material. ","3","There was quite a bit of material I had already seen in my masters, but there was also a lot of material I had not seen. In general the level of the material was higher though. ","1","I would point out that this is very subjective to myself. My research interests are very far away from standard economics, so the first year (anywhere) was never going to be good preparation in general for me. However I can say that I found the econometrics sequence lacking (with the notable exception of Pietro's sequence), which is very important as my work will be empirical. Indeed, I come away from this year thinking Pietro's lectures to be the only part of the first year that will be helpful in the future. ","5","I find it hard to comment on this, as I always knew the first year would be a challenge for me as math is not my forte. I do understand that Zurich wants to build itself into a top program modelled on the best US places. However the difficulty, especially in regards to the exams, felt without purpose in some regards. I think this problem is endemic to economics PhDs and not specific to Zurich, but the first year does feel like an unnecessary baptism of fire. I do not think anyone needs to be challenged this much to learn the relevant material. ","5","This was one of the few positive aspects of the first year, and really helped all of us get through this.

This didn't really happen in micro (though it seems programming is much less useful in micro), and in macro the attempt to make us use matlab seemed well intentioned, but I think very few people bothered.

","5","I very much enjoyed these, though it seemed I was in the minority. I think some students were not very interested in learning about research in fields they are not planning to do work in, but I think the more general problem was that we had so much work to do and so these were given low priority.
